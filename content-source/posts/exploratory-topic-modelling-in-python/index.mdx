abstract: Topic modelling is a technique by which documents within a corpus are clustered based on how certain groups of terms are used together within the text.  The commonalities between such term groupings tend to form what we would normally call “topics”, providing a way to automatically categorise documents by their structural content, rather than a more metadata-based knowledge system.  Using resources held with EHRI's collections, this notebook offers learners an introduction to 'LDA' topic modelling using Python in a step-by-step guide.

Topic modelling is a machine-learning technique that finds patterns in language use within a corpus of documents, and clusters those documents accordingly.   The commonalities in ther patterns form “topics”, providing a way to automatically categorise documents by their structural content. The specific type of topic modelling covered in this resource is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation - 'LDA'.

This EHRI notebook walks readers through the process of topic modelling transcripts obtained through the [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/) (USHMM) using Python and accompanies the article published in the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) Document Blog entitled "Exploratory Topic Modelling in Python".
