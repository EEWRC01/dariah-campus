QA catalogue is a metadata quality assessment tool developed for MARC21 and PICA metadata schema based library catalogues. Catalogues use vocabularies internally for recording their own structure and the terms particular data elements might contain, and externally for enhancing the descriptive data elements. This latter category covers two main areas: subject indexing and normalisation of (personal, family, corporate, geographical) names, titles and events. The tool reads MARC or PICA files (in different formats), analyses some quality dimensions, and saves the results into CSV files.
