This session teaches the students the foundations of Grew, a declarative tree query language, working with its implementation in TEITOK. We demonstrate the power of tree querying on searching the syntactically parsed Shakespeare corpus for salient semantic participants of a verb, which grammatical constructions to look for and how to implement the search in Grew.
