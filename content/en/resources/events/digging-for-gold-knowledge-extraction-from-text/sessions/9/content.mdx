This session aims to introduce visualisation grammars and their applications to accelerate exploratory data analysis in digital humanities projects by allowing users to create interactive visualisations with minimal effort in a Jupyter notebook. To this end, a real application will be built by replicating the design process of a visualisation system based on machine-annotated textual data, in a similar setup to many digital humanities research projects.
