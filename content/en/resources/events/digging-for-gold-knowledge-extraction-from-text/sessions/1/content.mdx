In this lesson, students will learn how to use the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) to download a corpus and then use Python and regular expressions to clean the text data. Students will learn how to remove unwanted characters and symbols, tokenise the text into individual words, and how to remove stop words.
This lesson will equip students with the skills to clean and preprocess text data for further analysis and natural language processing tasks.
