In this lesson, students will use the natural language processing library, spaCy, to extract all the "scary" verbs from a corpus of horror books. They will then use the similarity function in spaCy to determine which verbs are most closely related to the concept of fear. Additionally, they will determine which book is the "scariest" by calculating the ratio of scary verbs to total words in each book. This exercise will provide students with an understanding of how natural language processing can be used to analyse and compare different works of literature based on a specific set of criteria.
