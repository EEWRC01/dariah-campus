In this lecture, I am sharing some of my personal experiences and observations on the use of new media in performative arts. I am discussing the ways in which digital elements such as projections, sound, and interactive media can enhance and transform live performances. At the same time, I am exploring some of my doubts and uncertainties regarding the integration of new media into performative art practices.
