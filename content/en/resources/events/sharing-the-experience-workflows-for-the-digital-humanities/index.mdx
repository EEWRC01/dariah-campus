## Université de Neuchâtel, December 2019

In December 2019, the University of Neuchâtel hosted a second Swiss DARIAH workshop, organised by DARIAH-EU, the University of Neuchâtel and the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics within the DESIR project. Young scholars were invited to present their research in depth and to discuss together methodological, data management and research workflow issues. We are happy to present the papers resulting from this meeting.
