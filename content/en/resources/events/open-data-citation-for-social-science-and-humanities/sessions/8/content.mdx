## Contrasting Platforms and Infrastructures as Configurations for Data Sharing: Jean Christophe Plantin### Abstract*Contrasting platforms and infrastructures as configurations for data sharing.*This talk will discuss the impact on scholarship when data sharing is increasingly organized by social media platforms. It does so by contrasting these entities with existing data infrastructures that acquire, curate, and process these data for archiving and further dissemination. The analysis of routine, procedures, and everyday work of data processing staff at a social science data archive will provide elements to detail the “regime of care” that define infrastructure towards research data, and how it contrasts with digital intermediaries in organizing data circulation.<Link link={{"discriminant":"download","value":"/assets/content/downloads/en/resources/events/open-data-citation-for-social-science-and-humanities/sessions/4/downloads-9-1-plantin-pdf"}}>Download</Link><Speakers>

These data, which are usually very expensive to produce, are often lost at the end of the project. They are therefore rarely reused, due to a lack of financial, human and technical resources of the communities that produced them. This talk will present the general approach, both technical and educational, used by Huma-Num infrastructure to address these issues.<Link link={{"discriminant":"download","value":"/assets/content/downloads/en/resources/events/open-data-citation-for-social-science-and-humanities/sessions/10/downloads-9-2-larrousse-pdf"}}>Download</Link><Speakers>
